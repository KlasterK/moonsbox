1. Space is air here.
2. Here we call heat capacity how willingly a point changes (gives or takes) its temperature. And if the heat capacity is high, then the temperature of the point is harder to change. If the heat capacity is zero, then the point immediately takes or gives away all the heat that its neighbors give or take away. 
3. Thermal conductivity is how willingly a point shares its temperature with others. If it is 1, then the point immediately equalizes its temperature and its neighbor's (if we imagine that there are only 2 points in the neighborhood). If it is 0, then it never shares its temperature.
